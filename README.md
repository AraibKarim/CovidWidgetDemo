## Configurable Intent

You can edit the widget by selecting a country through Intents.

## Note

- You cant select the country from the application right now because it requires 'Appgroups' to communicate with the widget. You can add Appgroups to add the functionality.
- As mentioned in Xcode 12 beta release notes, Xcode 12 beta #2 has few known issues while configuring a widget. Workaround: delete the app and run it again.

## Run the Project?

Just download the project and run it in Xcode 12

## Compatibility 

iOS 14.0.
